	    <p>I'm a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/">Department of Philosophy</a> at the University of Otago, New Zealand. Before coming to Otago, I did my B.A. in Philosophy at the State University of Maringá in Brazil, where I'm originally from.</p>
<p>I'm currently writing a dissertation in philosophy of mind, with particular emphasis on perception and memory. I attempt to develop a pragmatist view of the mind and its objects, which is grounded on the classical pragmatism of Charles S. Peirce, to deal with contemporary problems relating to perception and memory.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of my research topics can be found on my <a href="/research">Research</a> page.</p>
