    <p>I'm a PhD student at the University of Otago, New Zealand. Before coming to Otago, I did my B.A. in Philosophy at the State University of Maringá in Brazil, where I'm originally from.</p>

I'm currently writing a dissertation in philosophy of mind, with particular emphasis on perception and memory. I attempt to develop a pragmatist view of the mind and its objects, which is grounded on the classical pragmatism of Charles S. Peirce, that can be put to work to deal with contemporary problems relating to perception and memory.

A more detailed description of my research topics can be found on my <a href="/research">Research</a> page.
