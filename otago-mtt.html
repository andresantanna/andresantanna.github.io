			<h1 align="center"><b>Mental Time Travel: Origins and Function</b></h1>
			<br />
			<img src="/imgs/poster.png" height="30%" width="30%" border="1px">

			<p text-align="justify">The idea that episodic memory is a form of mental time travel has played a central role in the development of psychological research on memory. Originally introduced by psychologist Endel Tulving, the mental time travel view of memory suggests that episodic memory is just one realization of a more general cognitive capacity that human beings have to “travel” in subjective time. This idea raises important philosophical questions about the nature of episodic memory and its relationship to mental time travel. Two important questions that have received a lot of attention recently are about the evolutionary origins and the function of mental time travel.
