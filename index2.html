	    <p>I'm currently a Teaching Fellow in Philosophy at the <a href="http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/departments/school-of-humanities/school-of-humanities_home.cfm">School of Humanities</a> at Massey University in New Zealand and I've just recently submitted my PhD thesis in Philosophy at the University of Otago.</p> 
<p> My research interests are in philosophy of mind and philosophy of psychology, more specifically in questions pertaining to the relationship between episodic memory and different forms of mental time travel, the nature of mnemonic and perceptual representations, and the nature of the objects of memory.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of my research topics can be found in my <a href="/research">Research</a> page.</p>
